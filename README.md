# IManager

## ASP.NET MVC 5 application for invoices management

Notes:

* As an unregistered user, the application can be accessed only in Homepage
* There are two types of application users: Guest and Manager
* After completing registration through the form, registered user has a Guest role and can only view/inspect invoices
* Only managers have the privilege for adding, updating and deleting invoices. Two accounts are already registered with Manager role, so it's possible to log in with data as follows:
1. Email: harisalikadic@imanager.com; Password: "Haris123."
2. Email: ivonamarkovic@imanager.com; Password: "Ivona123."
